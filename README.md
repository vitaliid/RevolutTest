# RevolutTest

This app demonstrates transfer between two existing accounts. Of course it can be improved by:
* different validations and error handlings
* providing more information while operation failed
* having transaction things
* using BigDecimal 
* and etc. 

But I was asked to avoid over-engineering of solution
